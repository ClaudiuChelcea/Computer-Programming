This "Source Code Optimized Version" folder contains my second method of solving the homework,
being <b>98%</b> more efficient than the previous version (reducing time from a few hours to less than 2 minutes).

Solutions:
Task 1:
Saved the matrix and the number of elements on each line in separately dinamically allocated arrays
Calculated the border created by the outer bytes by using char pointer conversions for extracting certain bytes

Task 2:
Separated the modification operations in three distinct functions 
Modified elements using pointer arithmetic for speed

Task 3:
Generated a new square matrix from the previous matrix
Implemented an flood fill algorithm to calculate the '00' adjacent byte groups size and fill 
the checked groups with non-zero values.
