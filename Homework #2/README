# Task 1
The first number received, n, represents the number of lines in the image to be reconstructed. The following
lines contain information about the pixels of the image. Thus, on a line i, there is: mi ai(0),ai(1), ai(2) ...  ai(m-1)
where m is the number of elements on a line and aij are the elements
The first thing to know is whether the protective shield surrounding the galaxy is sufficiently charged.
It is defined by the bytes on the outline of the map. The degree of load is defined by the arithmetic mean of
them. It is desired to display this environment on stdout. Because it seeks the best possible accuracy for
solving this mission, it is required that the arithmetic mean be calculated with 8 exact decimals.
Careful!
• In solving this task, all bytes are considered as sign numbers.

# Task 2:
Next, correct the image to get the initial map. Following the map from Task 1, you`ll get a value, k,
representing the number of changes, followed by a sequence of k instructions to be applied
to make the necessary changes.
A change is coded as follows: Operation SizeOfDate Line IndexDate [ValueNew]
Operation = The correction to be applied, represented by a letter that can be one of the following
options:
• “M” - modify
• “D” - delete
• “S” - swap
DataSize = The size of the portion of data to be corrected. It can be of the type:
• “C” - char (1 byte)
• “S” - short (2 bytes)
• “I” - int (4 bytes)
Line = Line where data will be corrected.
IndexDate = Index of the portion of data to be corrected. IndexDate is at least 0 for the Swap operation
and at least 1 for Modify and Delete. 
NewValue = The value that will appear instead of the old data to make the correction. This value is given
only in the case of modification operations, the size dimension corresponding to the data type mentioned by
DimensiuneDate
For the modification operation, the case if the area is outside the existing map must be treated carefully.
In this case, the remaining spaces between the old dimension and the new modified bytes will be filled with zeros,

 Task 3:
Now that the map has been rebuilt, all that is needed is an escape plan. It is known that the areas they contain
zero represents black holes. To succeed in this mission, the rebels must know the location of the largest
black holes. A supermassive black hole represents several black holes with the property that any
black hole can be reached by passing only through other black holes. The transition from one black hole to another is
can be done in the directions: up, down, left or right (not diagonally). 
Supermassiveness is represented by the number of black holes included in a meeting.
The location of the largest black hole and its supermassiveness are required. By location is meant the black hole
component with i minimum, j minimum, in this order.
Careful!
• If there are several black holes with the same supermassivity, the data for the one will be displayed
which is located at i minimum, j minimum.
• The map in which the hole will be searched is the one obtained after solving task 2.
The map must be stored so that at all times each line has exactly the minimum number of bytes required
at that time, allocating / reallocating each line as needed.
Black hole = "00" byte
