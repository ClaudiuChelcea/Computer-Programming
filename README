## Problem 1: On the fly analysis
Task:
In Ninel's forest the N trees grow in a single row. Each tree (0 ≤ i ≤ N - 1) has a height xi.
The forester wants to make some statistics for the forest district, what trees to cut in order to
rejuvenate the forest. 

Specifically, he wants to cut only those trees that are already too big and shade the neighboring trees.
A tree is called a special tree if and only if the following conditions are true:
1. the trees i - 1 and i + 1 exist
2. xi − 1 < xi and xi> xi + 1

In this problem we will not cut down trees, but we will calculate the following:
1. S = sum of the height of special trees;
2. m_a = arithmetic mean of the heights of special trees;
3. xmax_odd = the maximum height of a special tree with an odd index;
4. xmin_even = minimum height of a special tree with even index.

ATTENTION! The given input is very large, so its storage is not possible using arrays.


Sollution:
    I created a display function that will be called at the end, with the parameters that are obtained before calling.
    The idea of implementation <without arrays>: 
    	-I start with two variables, representing the first two trees, and then, iteratively, a 3rd parameter, var_3.
    	-The loop will check if var_2 is a special tree and check the conditions for xmax_ odd, xmin_even, etc ..) 
    	-Then it will advance the trees by one unit, so we go through them 3 at a time.
    	-At the end, the function is called and the obtained values are displayed.
