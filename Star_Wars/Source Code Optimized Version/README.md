This "Source Code Optimized Version" folder contains my second method of solving the homework,
being <b>98%</b> more efficient than the previous version (reducing time from a few hours to less than 2 minutes).

Solutions:<br>
Task 1:<br>
Saved the matrix and the number of elements on each line in separately dinamically allocated arrays <br>
Calculated the border created by the outer bytes by using char pointer conversions for extracting certain bytes<br>
<br>
Task 2:<br>
Separated the modification operations in three distinct functions <br>
Modified elements using pointer arithmetic for speed<br>
<br>
Task 3:<br>
Generated a new square matrix from the previous matrix<br>
Implemented an flood fill algorithm to calculate the '00' adjacent byte groups size and fill <br>
the checked groups with non-zero values.<br>
