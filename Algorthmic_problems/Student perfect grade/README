# Task:
At CodeInVim University, scholarships are awarded to students with the most points. 
We will use a the scenario in which it assumes that during a year a student has N subjects. Every
subject is characterized by a grade xi (obtained by the student) and a number of credits(reflecting
difficulty of the subject).

We will define the score as follows:
P = sum of(xi,ci)

Mihai has just found out all the grades from year 1 and he is thinking of keeping the courses for
the subjects he will go to for magnifications, because he wants to be among the scholarship holders.
He wonders what is the minimum number of subjects (with a grade other than 10) that he should have taken 10
so that his score will be greater than or equal to a given minimum_score(the last student`s student with scholarship points).

# Solution:
   I created an interchange function, a function that constantly returns the student`s current score
   and a function that finds the optimal number of courses he needs to improve his grades at to get a scholarship.
   After getting the input, as long as the student`s score is lower than desired scored, it is raised,
   but only as many times as there are subjects left to bring to 10.
   If the desired score is reached, we go out and display.
   If the goal has not yet been reached, but the courses to be brought to maximum grade are finished,
   we display -1, meaning that getting the scholarship is impossible.
