# Task:
 A general property of natural numbers says that for any natural number N, doing, repeatedly,
difference between the number dialed with the same digits, but in descending order (n_descending) and the number
consisting of its digits in ascending order (n_increasing), after a variable number (k) of steps, it is reached
a sequence of numbers (p1, p2, ..., pm) of size m that is repeated indefinitely in the different calculation.

This property is also preserved for numbers in the writing of which a digit can appear from any number of
times or is equal to 0 if:
• The numbers n_descending and n_increasing are formed from all the same number of occurrences of the digits
from 1 to 9
• The digit 0 is completely removed from writing n_increasing.

Do: write a program that, reading from the keyboard a natural number N, follows (repeatedly) the algorithm
of calculation of the different sequences is between n_decreasing and n_increasing and gives as output:

• First of all, the number of differences that are made until the start of the period
• Second, display the sequence of numbers that are repeated, each once, in thr order in which
they are discovered by the proposed algorithm.


# Solution:
   I created a sort selection function that will help us sort the digits of the given number saved as an array
   then put in another vector the resulting differences.
   The program will check if the period started (through an loop that shows if repetitions occur)
   If so, we save the period in the array named aux
   At the end, displayed the desired result: the number of differences and the period found.
