# Task:
A griddler is a game similar to Sudoku, which aims to complete with black and white cases a grid of
variable size (N rows x M columns), based on specified restrictions for each row and column.
Thus, for each row, respectively each column, the number of black colored cases groups is specified, as well
as their size, in the order in which they appear (from left to right for lines and from top to bottom for
columns). 

Two consecutive groups will always be separated by at least one white house.
Ninel wants you to create a program to help him cheat in this game, checking for him if he has
correctly completed such a grid. |

The input data will be read from STDIN:
• On the first line you will find a T number, representing the number of puzzles to be checked;
• On the following lines the puzzles to be checked.

For each puzzle:
• On the first line, you will find two natural numbers N and M representing the dimensions of the grid;
• On the following N lines the restrictions for each of the lines, in ascending order of the line index;
• On the following M lines the restrictions for each of the columns, in ascending order of the index
column;
- For a row / column with K colored groups, the restrictions will be specified via K + 1
natural numbers representing, in order: the number of colored groups on that row or column (K value),
 and the size for each colored group.
• On the following N rows and M columns, the grids completed by Nigel, given as a matrix of 1 and 0 in which a
a value of 0 represents a white case, and a value of 1 represents a colored case.

# Solution:
   I created 3 functions: one that displays the Correct / Error answer, depending on the "output" variable
   And two functions that go first on the rows and then on columns of the matrix and check the respective conditions
   The main function contains a loop that will receive the number of nomograms and will start checking each one.
