#  Task: On the fly analysis
In Ninel's forest the N trees grow in a single row. Each tree (0 ≤ i ≤ N - 1) has a height of xi.

The forester wants to make more statistics for the forest district, in order to cut special trees
in view of forest rejuvenation. Specifically, he will cut only those trees that are already too big 
and shade the neighboring trees.

A tree is considered special if and only if the following conditions are true:
1. the tres i-1 and i+1 exist
2. xi - 1 < xi and xi> xi + 1.

In this issue we will not cut trees, but we will calculate the following:
1. S = sum of the height of special trees;
2. m_a = arithmetic mean of the heights of special trees;
3. xmax_odd = the maximum height of a special tree with an odd index;
4. xmin_even = minimum height of a special tree with even index.

Restrictions and clarifications
• 0 < N < 10^7
• 0 < xi < 10^6
ATTENTION! The given array is very large, so its storage is limitted and it is not possible to store 
the value using arrays. 

# Solution:

   I have created a display function that will be called at the end, with the parameters that are obtained before calling.
   
   The idea of implementation (without vectors): 
   I start with two variables, representing the first two trees, and then, iteratively, read a third parameter: var_3.
   The loop will check if var_2 is a special tree and, if true, check the conditions for xmax_ odd, xmin_par, etc ..
   Then  it will advance the trees by one position, so we go through them 3 at a time.
   At the end, the function is called and the obtained values are displayed.
